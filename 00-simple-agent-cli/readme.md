Agno provides an interactive CLI for testing agents, teams, and workflows. Use cli_app() for synchronous or acli_app() for async execution. This lets you have back-and-forth conversations in your terminal.

Example:

agent.cli_app(stream=True)

Found in the debugging pages for agents and teams.

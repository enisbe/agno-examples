    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an interactive dashboard to facilitate a non-linear exploration of the report's content. The structure progresses from a high-level summary to a deep-dive section and concludes with a comparative synthesis. A top navigation bar allows users to select a specific framework, dynamically updating the main content area. This avoids overwhelming the user with a long, linear document. The flow is: 1) Absorb key findings in the header. 2) Select a framework for detailed analysis. 3) Switch between frameworks to explore. 4) View the comparative analysis section with charts and tables to synthesize information for decision-making. This task-oriented structure is more usable and engaging than a static report, directly supporting the user's goal of evaluating and selecting a framework. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: GitHub Stars for each framework. -> Goal: Compare Popularity. -> Viz: Horizontal Bar Chart (Chart.js). -> Interaction: Hover for tooltips with exact values. -> Justification: Bar charts are excellent for direct comparison of discrete values. -> Library: Chart.js (Canvas).
        - Report Info: Ratings for Learning Curve & Enterprise Readiness. -> Goal: Compare multi-dimensional profiles. -> Viz: Radar Chart (Chart.js). -> Interaction: Legend click to toggle framework visibility. -> Justification: Radar charts excel at showing the strengths and weaknesses of different items across multiple standardized variables, providing a quick "shape" profile for each framework. -> Library: Chart.js (Canvas).
        - Report Info: Detailed framework analysis sections. -> Goal: Inform, Detail. -> Presentation: Dynamically updated HTML content blocks. -> Interaction: Click framework selector buttons to switch content. -> Justification: Hiding non-selected content reduces cognitive load and keeps the interface clean. -> Method: Vanilla JS DOM manipulation.
        - Report Info: Strategic Recommendations. -> Goal: Guide, Inform. -> Presentation: Accordion UI. -> Interaction: Click to expand/collapse sections. -> Justification: Accordions organize dense text into manageable, user-triggered chunks. -> Method: Vanilla JS.

    "Overall Most Promising Frameworks": `
        <p class="mb-4">Two frameworks currently stand out as the most promising for a wide range of serious, production-oriented applications, albeit for different reasons:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
            <li><strong>LangGraph:</strong> It is the clear leader for building complex, mission-critical systems where control, auditability, and reliability are non-negotiable. Its robust enterprise ecosystem provides a complete, end-to-end solution, making it a sound strategic choice for organizations with mature engineering practices.</li>
            <li><strong>CrewAI:</strong> It is the leader in developer experience and accessibility. Its intuitive, role-based paradigm makes it exceptionally fast for building and prototyping collaborative multi-agent systems. Its strong community and clear path to production make it an equally strong strategic choice, particularly for teams that need to deliver value quickly.</li>
        </ul>
    `,
    "Use-Case Specific Recommendations": `
        <p class="mb-4">The optimal choice of framework is highly dependent on the specific context of the project.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
            <li><strong>For Rapid Prototyping & High Accessibility:</strong> <strong>CrewAI</strong> is the top recommendation for its speed and ease of use. <strong>SmolAgents</strong> is an excellent alternative for a minimalist, code-first approach.</li>
            <li><strong>For Complex, State-Aware Enterprise Workflows:</strong> <strong>LangGraph</strong> is the undisputed choice. <strong>Google ADK</strong> is a powerful competitor, especially for organizations on GCP.</li>
            <li><strong>For Performance-Critical & Highly Scalable Systems:</strong> <strong>Agno</strong> should be at the top of the evaluation list for its speed and memory efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>For Structured, Type-Safe, Single-Agent Tasks:</strong> <strong>Pydantic AI</strong> is the ideal framework when data integrity is the primary challenge.</li>
        </ul>
    `,
    "Future Outlook and Innovative Standouts": `
        <p class="mb-4">The agentic landscape continues to evolve at a breakneck pace. Several frameworks stand out as particularly innovative:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
            <li><strong>Agno:</strong> Its early and aggressive focus on performance and efficiency positions it perfectly to meet future demand as operational costs and latency become critical business considerations.</li>
            <li><strong>SmolAgents:</strong> The "code-as-action" paradigm is a genuinely novel approach. As LLMs become more proficient at code generation, this method could become more powerful and mainstream.</li>
            <li><strong>Google ADK:</strong> The power of deep platform integration cannot be underestimated. As Google continues to build out the ADK and its connections to GCP services, it will become an increasingly compelling all-in-one solution for enterprises on Google Cloud.</li>
